A very simple snippet for generating unique ids for objects with object merger.

The generateid function in object merger starts at its first index, so it does not return a completely unique id and may overwrite custom objects. 

This script will continue to loop until it finds a unique id. Very simple, but very useful.

This script only returns a unique object id. It does not create the actual object for you.

Must be run through ObjectMerger
